## Overview
To showcase my expertise in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and testing, I developed a **Cucumber-Cypress Test Automation Framework** for the e-commerce website **[Sydney Kart](https://portfoliosai.link/sydneykart/)**. This project demonstrates various testing methodologies and best practices.

### BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
#### Key Features
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Enhances test maintenance and readability by encapsulating page elements and actions.
- **Global Data Parameterization**: Allows running tests with multiple data sets without modifying test scripts.
- **Test Tagging**: Enables selective execution, skipping, inclusion, and exclusion of tests based on tags.
- **Scenario Outlines and Data Tables**: Supports data-driven testing with multiple scenarios using different data sets.
- **Encapsulation and Reusable Components**: Applies Object-Oriented Programming principles to create reusable test components.
- **Global Variables**: Ensures consistent data management across tests.
- **Page Elements Segregation**: Organizes locators and actions for better maintainability.
- **Static Fixtures & Dynamic Fixtures** - Image Uploads, Dynamic Form Data Generation.
- **Hook Priority Execution**: Defines the execution order of hooks to maintain test integrity.
- **Test Dependency Management**: Uses pre-condition and post-condition hooks to manage test dependencies effectively.


### Cypress Test Automation
- **Global Timeouts in Cypress**: Configured to handle varying response times and ensure test reliability.
- **Parallel Execution**: Reduces test execution time and increases efficiency.
- **Cypress Login & Authentication**: Validates user authentication processes for secure access.
- **Cypress Form Submissions**: Tests form inputs and submission behaviors.
- **Cypress Data Display**: Verifies dynamic content loading, such as:
  - User profiles
  - Pagination functionality
- **Cypress Stripe Payments**: Ensures proper integration and functionality of Stripe payment processing.
- **Cypress File Uploads**: Validates correct operation of file upload features.
- **Cypress Product Filtering and Sorting**: Tests product filters and sorting options.
- **Order Confirmation Process**: Verifies the accuracy and reliability of the order confirmation workflow.

### Summary
While the test suite is not exhaustive, it includes common **Gherkin** and **BDD** combinations, providing a comprehensive overview of testing strategies in a BDD-driven **Cypress** automation framework.

## 🛠️ Setup Project

To get this project up and running in your development environment, follow these step-by-step instructions.

### 🍴 Prerequisites

We need to install or make sure that these tools are pre-installed on your machine:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): It is a JavaScript runtime build.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): It is an open source version control system.
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node): It is a package manager for JavaScript.

### 🛠️ Installation Instructions

1.  Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AshwanthSai/Cucumber-Cypress-Framework.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd Cucumber-Cypress-Framework
    ```

3.  Install Cypress and other dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running Cypress Tests

### Running Tests in Different Modes

#### Run Headless Mode

To run Cypress in headless mode, use the following command:

```sh
npm run headless --tags="not @login and @regression or @smoke"
```

To run tests in headless mode with parallel execution:

```sh
npm run headless:parallel
```

#### Run Headed Mode

To run Cypress in headed mode, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start --tags="not @login and @regression or @smoke"
```

To run tests in headed mode with parallel execution:

```sh
npm run start:parallel
```

#### Run Tests with Cypress-Parallel

For advanced parallel execution using `cypress-parallel`, use:

```sh
npm run cy:parallel
```

### Viewing the Test Report

To generate and view the test report, use the command:

```sh
npm run report
```

### Running a Live Server for the Cypress Report

1. Navigate to the report directory:

   ```sh
   cd cypress/report
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser or run a local server:

   ```sh
   npx http-server
   ```

   This will start a simple web server, allowing you to view the report in your browser. You can then access the report by navigating to the address provided by `http-server` (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
