Gherkin Best Practices and Guidelines

Basic Structure
Feature: Give your feature a clear, descriptive title

Each user story clearly identifies 
who the feature is for, "As a..."
what they want to accomplish,  "I want to..."
and why it brings value, "So that..."

    As a customer
    I want to add items to my shopping cart
    So that I can purchase multiple items at once

    As an account holder
    I want to transfer money between my accounts
    So that I can manage my finances efficiently

    As a social media user
    I want to create and share posts with my network
    So that I can communicate with friends and followers

Background: Use for common setup steps repeated across scenarios
Scenarios: Each should be independent and focused on one behavior
Steps: Keep them simple, clear, and in a logical order
Each Step Should be Atomic and Interdependent

    Focus on Behaviors, Not Features - What and not How ?
    Write scenarios that describe specific user behaviors
    Each scenario should test one discrete piece of functionality
    Name scenarios based on the behavior being tested, not the implementation

    Scenario: User can add a single item to an empty shopping cart
    Scenario: User shopping experience
    Scenario Outline: Validating different account types


Step Guidelines
Given: Set up the initial context/state - Context
And/But: Use to extend any of the above step types - Extend Context
When: Describe the action being taken - Atomic Action
Then: Define the expected outcome - Outcome

Writing Effective Steps
Keep steps atomic (one action per step)
Use consistent language and terminology
Be specific but not overly technical
Avoid UI implementation details when possible
Use parameters for variable data in quotes: "Admin"
Avoid conjunctions like "and" within a single step

  Given I am on the product details page for "Wireless Headphones"
  When I click the "Add to Cart" button
  Then I should see "Wireless Headphones" in my shopping cart
  And the cart total should show "1 item"

  Given I am on the home page
  When I search for "headphones"
  And I click on the first product
  And I add it to my cart
  And I proceed to checkout
  And I enter my shipping information
  Then I should be able to place my order

  Scenario Outline: Validating different account types
  Given I am on the account creation page
  When I select "<account_type>" as my account type
  Then I should see the "<required_documents>" message

Data Management
Use Scenario Outline with Examples table for data-driven tests
Use Data Tables for complex input data
Use Doc Strings for multiline text inputs

Tagging
Use @tags to categorize and organize scenarios
Common tags: @smoke, @regression, @wip, @ignore
Use tags for filtering tests during execution

Readability
Write scenarios from the user's perspective
Use domain-specific language that stakeholders understand
Focus on business value, not technical implementation
Format consistently (indentation, line breaks)

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Don't make scenarios dependent on each other
Avoid technical language in scenario descriptions
Don't include too many steps in a single scenario
Avoid vague steps like "I do something" or "The system works correctly"
Don't repeat step definitions that could be moved to Background
